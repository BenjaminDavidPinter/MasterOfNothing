# Master of Nothing

## About this project
There are few instances where I've levered all of my combined skills from 8 years of professional software development in a single project. I've built webapis, sites, and services to support the company I work for. This project is supposed to be a challenge for me to fill all of those roles, again, in a capacity that is self serving. That affords me time and opportunity to do things the exact way I want to. 

I hope to have the opportunity to collaborate with people I know, or people I meet along the way. The goals of this project extend beyond writing good code. I look forward to doing everything I can to provide the product I visualize. 

## Outstanding Project Goals
I can't sit here and list every goal I have, because I don't really have the time, and the specifics aren't clear. Instead, we'll be working feature by feature to accomplish what it is I want. So as this continues, we will create small, simple, and achievable goals.

## Goal #1
### Establish a Backend

For those of you involved with the field know the wide set of options we have to store data. For the sake of simplicity, and portability, I want to run this on Sqlite.

[ ] Integrate SQLite with Api and Service Projects
